‘ ‘ computes the V(x) value function according to x. It saves it in a file located in a repertory that must be defined in line XX.
The level of income aimed must also be entered line X.

Builds viable trajectories based on V(x) computed by the above script. It must get the file in the folder above defined.

Builds the ‘capped’ trajectories. It can scan a variety of SFU_max values (if NB_replicate on line >1)
or compute detailed statistics for a specific SFU_max (if NB_replicate = 1).
In the latter case, the value of SFU_max must be entered line XX.
